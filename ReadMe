The aim of this project is to understand the machine learning model used for image classification.

In this project, we will classify the images based on weather the image is of a dog or a cat.

We will break the data set as testing data and training data.

we will first import the required libraries

for this project, we will use the sequential classifier from the keras library.

we will first train the model using the training data and then test the model with the testing data

once done, we will try to analyse a image and allow the model to classify the image as either a dog or a cat.
